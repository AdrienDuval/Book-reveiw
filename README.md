Project Name: Laravel Book Review

** Overview: **
The Laravel Book Review is a comprehensive book review application that empowers users to explore, rate, and review books. Users can search for books, sort them based on various criteria such as latest, popularity, and highest ratings, and view detailed information about each book, including the author's name, average review rating, and the total number of reviews. The application facilitates an interactive review system where users can leave reviews along with ratings ranging from 0 to 5 stars.

Features:

Search and Sorting: Users can easily search for books and sort them based on criteria like latest, popularity over the last month or six months, and highest ratings over the last month or six months.
Book Listings: The home page displays a list of books with their authors, average review ratings (in both numerical and star formats), and the total number of reviews for each book. Pagination ensures smooth navigation through book listings.
Review System: Each book page provides detailed information about the book, including its name, author, average review rating, and a button to add a review. Users can leave reviews along with ratings, and all reviews are displayed chronologically with timestamps.
Form Validation: All forms on the website are validated with CSRF protection and required fields to prevent empty submissions.
Technologies Used:

Alpine.js
Hosting: SiteGround
Your Role:
As a personal project, I handled all aspects of development independently.

Challenges Faced:

Controller Mastery: Grasping the concepts of controllers in Laravel and understanding their role in handling user requests and responses.
Blade Components: Learning how to effectively utilize components in Blade templates, understanding their functionality, and the advantages they offer in terms of code reusability.
Database Relationships: Understanding and implementing database relationships in Laravel to establish connections between different models and tables.
Future Plans:
In the future, I plan to implement user authentication to require users to log in before leaving reviews. This will enable the application to track reviews by individual users and provide personalized experiences. Additionally, I aim to enhance the review system to display the usernames of users who left reviews on each book, adding transparency and accountability.
